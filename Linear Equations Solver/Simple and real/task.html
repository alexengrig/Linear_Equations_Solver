<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A linear equation is called linear because it doesn't consist of variables with powers - only with variables with power 1. Linear equations can be found in different fields of science and technology. For the simplest examples, see <a href="https://sciencing.com/linear-equations-used-everyday-life-6022370.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> link. In this project, you will write a lot more powerful solver, but in this stage, you will write such a simple one.</p>

<p>Write a program that solves the equation a * x = b.</p>

<p>Numbers a and b should be read from the first line of the standard input. You should output the value x, which turns the equation to be true. For example, if the input contains numbers 5 and 3, this means that you should interpret this as equation 5 * x = 3. For this example, the answer would be 0.6 since 5 * 0.6 = 3.</p>

<h2>Output example</h2>

<p>Input:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">5 3</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">0.6</code></pre>
